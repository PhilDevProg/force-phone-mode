# Force Phone Mode

This is an extension that forces the phone mode on GNOME Shell Mobile. Useful
for testing GNOME Shell Mobile on non-mobile devices.

Note that this extension will only work on
[GNOME Shell Mobile](https://gitlab.gnome.org/verdre/mobile-shell) and will
crash with the following error on normal GNOME:

```
Main.layoutManager._updateIsPhone is not a function
```
